# IBDLR
code for Implicit Block Diagonal Low-Rank Representation and Robust Kernel Low-Rank Representation.

The parameters rho_mu and rho_mu in the IBDLR.m control the speed of the decay. 
Setting them small can accelerate the convergence but may degrade the clustering accuracy. They should be turned according to the data.
